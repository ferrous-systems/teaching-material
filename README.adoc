= Ferrous Teaching Material

This is free workshop material produced by {ferrous} for trainings.
mailto:contact@ferrous-systems.com[Get in touch] for a custom quote.
The time for the full course is around three to four days.

The material is created with people with zero Rust experience but
with a programming background in mind.

Ferrous Systems offers a large Rust curriculum for both beginner and
advanced Rust developers.

Ferrous Systems specialises in custom, topic focused workshops for
enterprises starting or expanding their use of Rust. Supplemental to our courses, we
offer ongoing help and feedback.

= Overview

The materials are presented as a set of small, self-contained lessons on a specific topic.
Note that lessons might be revised, extended, or removed, when necessary to keep material up to date or relevant to new audiences.
Lessons can be arranged into courses exploring various aspects of Rust.

== Booking

See https://ferrous-systems.com/training for open courses or mail office@ferrous-systems.com for custom offers.

== Group setup

Ferrous Systems recommends a trainer per 6 attendees for full trainer
bandwidth. If possible, we recommend opting for groups of at least 12,
to efficiently allow for 2 trainers.

When selecting groups for training, we recommend that participants have a similar experience level in Rust, and similar goals for using the language when possible.
We are experienced with training developers from a wide range of backgrounds and experience levels, and can design a training suitable for your team.

== Training material

Ferrous Systems offers our training material under MIT/Apache-2.0
license for source code (examples and exercises) and Creative Commons (CC-BY-SA) for textual
content.

Custom course material developed on request, including any provided examples or exercises, will be delivered directly to you as part of the training.

== Trainer staff


The Ferrous Systems training staff consists of multiple Rust project
maintainers and domain experts, active in multiple working groups. This
makes sure our trainers are always up to speed on new developments and
can give current and authoritive answers.

Among those are:

* Florian Gilcher: Training Rust since 2015. Over 30 trainings, most for
large enterprises. Rust core team member and community team manager.
Broad knowledge about all aspects of Rust, with special knowledge on
network and async/concurrent programming.
* Jonathan Pallant: Training Rust since 2018. Focus on Rust for Beginners,
and Embedded Rust. Member of the Rust Embedded Working Group. Rust 'firsts'
include running code on the nRF9160, TM4C123 and RP2040 MCUs.
* Jonas Schievek: Training Rust since 2019. Focus on general Rust and
multiple architectures. Contributor to the Rust compiler. Great
knowledge of compilation details and performance concerns.
* Tanks Transfeld: Training Rust since 2018. Focus on general Rust and
Rust for beginners. Part of several Rust learning projects. All Rust
subjects, from async to bare metal. Great knowledge around beginners
concerns and how to get started.

Ferrous Systems can also collaborate with local trainers in Europe, US, Canada,
South America, South Africa, and Oceania.

= Courses

== Tailoring

Ferrous Systems offers courses in many different settings.

Courses will be tailored to the clients needs during an interview before
the event. This interview should happen as early as possible.

Specifically courses for companies in a transformation towards using
Rust will be tailored to the companies core subjects.

== The "three days" core

Ferrous Systems builds its core course around a _base course_ of three
days. This course consists of introduction into shared Rust subjects
plus application in _one_ domain. Three days gives enough time to focus
on this domain for at least one day, plus enough time to answer
questions coming up from the audience.

After a three days course, attendees will have a solid knowledge in
Rusts core concepts, especially Ownership and Borrowing. They will also
have the core skills necessary for efficient self-guided learning.

=== Variations

Variations of the course, such as a shorter or a longer version are
available.

==== "Three days" overview

A course that focuses more on an ecosystem overview over a detailed core
subject. It may cover up to 4 topics.

Attendees may not become productive in all areas, but get a good feeling
for them.

This course is perfect for engineering management that will most likely
not end up using Rust daily, but needs broad knowledge to assess Rust as
a technology. It is also frequently given in academic settings.

==== 5 days

The longer versions covers similar subjects as above, but in more
detail. This allows for exercises such as the construction of a larger piece of software
in the training group collaboratively.

These courses are recommended for people that are intended to be
multipliers in your organisation, teaching or leading other teams using Rust.

After 5 days, attendees will have solid knowledge in a topical domain
and full productivity.

==== 2 days

A condensed version of the three days course. Detailed topic deep dives
will be reduced and some self-guided exercises reduced to "code along"
sessions.

==== 2,4 and 8 hours topic tasters

Taster sessions that favor experiences over solid knowledge and get
people excited.

Perfect for conferences and internal all-hands to expand people's
horizons.

== Advanced courses

Advanced courses deepen a Rust subject and are indented for groups that
have already attended a course previously. They quickly refresh core knowledge
and then add a specific deep dive on topic. Advanced courses also differ
from base courses in that they include a number facilitated discussions
for attendees to share their experience.

Advanced courses are tailored like base courses to the need of the
group. For example, a basic course for asynchronous programming
explains how concurrent execution in Rust works, while the advanced one may
include writing your own execution engine.

= Topics

Ferrous Systems offers Rust courses for a wide variety of subjects. The
following is a non-exhaustive list of subjects.

Every subject with be taught with hands-on exercises.
