# Borrowing

## What you own, you can borrow

---

Ownership provides a solid semantic base, but becomes impractical in for the long run.

---

Reuse of data after a function call is not possible with ownership if the called function doesn't return the ownership to the value again.

---

Let's borrow instead!

---

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/borrowing/1.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

---

<pre class="diagram" data-source="chapters/shared/diagram/borrowing/1.diagram"></pre>

---

Simple borrowing can happen as often as you want.

---

What if we want to change the value?

---

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/borrowing/2.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

---

Mutable borrows are exclusive!

---

## The borrowing rules

Values can be:

* Borrowed immutably as often as you'd like
* Or mutably exactly once

Ownership remains in the calling context, as well as the deallocation.

---

What does this save us from?

---

## Do you see a potential problem?

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/borrowing/3.rs" data-trim="hljs rust"></code></pre>

---

It follows:

* for every type `T` there is a type `&T`
* for every type `T` there is a type `&mut T`
* `&&T` is a valid type
* `& &mut T` not a valid type. Why?

---

## Borrows are References

That means that we need to dereference them from time to time.

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/borrowing/4.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>
