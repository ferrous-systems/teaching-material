== !

Rust ships with two base libraries, libcore and libstd.

== !

libcore contains all types necessary to make the language work.

libcore is allocation free.

== !

libcore is usually not used directly, as its public interface is reexported by libstd.

== !

libstd contains standard functions, for example to interact with the file system. It has a dependency to the platform libc.
