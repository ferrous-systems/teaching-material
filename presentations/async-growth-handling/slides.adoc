= Async: Avoiding disaster and unbounded growth

== Information gathering

Your project is dynamic:

* Make it traceable
* Constantly monitor

== Backpressure

Backpressure is the process of "pushing back" on producers that are to fast.

This throttles the system, but allows it to not fail.

== Bounded vs. unbounded growth

* bounded channels are predictable
* unbounded are more dynamic
* bounded provide backpressure
* unbounded are useful if you know they are never beyond a certain size

==  Holding state

* Tasks can hold state
* Otherwise, Mutexes and RWlocks allow sharing

== Dropping futures

* Dropping a futures means cancelling it
* Be aware of what happens if it is cancelled

== Shutting down

* Make sure your signal handling is centralized
* Every component should subscribe to a cancel notification

== Implementing a custom Future: Pinning

* Futures are not allowed to move in Memory
* The type that describes that is called `Pin`
* Pinning is hard, but there's support libraries

== The poll protocol

Futures are `poll` based - that means they get asked if they are complete.

* This happens an infinite number of times, until they mark themselves complete
* The process is optimised through the `Waker` type
* Implementing poll yourself is rather easy
