== Parallelism

* Running on multiple OS/hardware threads
* Pre-emptive multitasking
* Handled by OS

== Parallelism

* Running on multiple OS/hardware threads
* Pre-emptive multitasking
* Handled by OS
* Best for: CPU-bound workloads

== Asynchrony

* Lightweight tasks
* Interleaving tasks
* Needs user-level scheduler (executor)

== Asynchrony

* Lightweight tasks
* Interleaving tasks
* Needs user-level scheduler (executor)
* Best for: I/O-bound workloads

== Asynchronous Advantages

* Many thousands of tasks simultaneously
* Lower overhead per-task
* Many I/O requests in flight

== Asynchrony in Rust

Example: making an HTTP request

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

== Async

* 'async' marks a function as asynchronous
* Changes the return type to a Future
* Running function creates the future

== Await

* '.await' creates an await point
* Yields control back to the executor
* '.await' returns when the future has finished

== Asynchrony in Rust

* [Graph of the example as execution flow]

== Asynchrony in Rust

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

* Question: How many tasks are running concurrently?

== Asynchrony in Rust

* By default no asynchrony in async/await
* Needs async operators
* Most common:
  * Join: wait for all async tasks to complete
  * Select: wait for one async task to complete

== Join example

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

== Select example
