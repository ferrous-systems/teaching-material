= Control Flow

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]

== Control Flow primitives

* `if`
* `match` and `enums`
* `for`, `while` and `loop` loops
* `return` and `?`

== Control Flow with `if`

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]
----

<1> Paranthesis around the conditional are not necessary
<2> Blocks need brackets, no shorthand

== Control Flow with `match`

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

<1> match arm
<2> default arm

== Control Flow with `match` and `enums`

[source,rust]
----
include::./3.rs[]
----

<1> `enum` can take multiple forms
<2> The forms are called "variants" and can carry data
<3> Enums are inspected by matching ...
<4> ... on the structure

== 2 important enums

[source,rust]

include::./4.rs[]
----

* `Option` describes the possible absence of a value
* `Result` describes that an operation might return an error instead

== Using `Option` and `Result`

== Match guards

[source,rust]
----
include::./7.rs[]
----

* Match guards allow further refining of a `match`

== Shorthand: `if let` conditionals

[source,rust]
----
include::./8.rs[]
----

* `if let` are idiomatic if only one case is of interest

== `loop`

[source,rust]
----
include::./9.rs[]
----

`loop` is used for arbitrary loops

== `for`

[source,rust]
----
include::./10.rs[]
----

`for` is used for iteration

== `while`

[source,rust]
----
include::./11.rs[]
----

`while` is used for conditional loops


== `return`

[source,rust]
----
include::./11b.rs[]
----

* `return` can be used for early returns
* The result of the last expression of a function is always returned


== `?`


[source,rust]
----
include::./12.rs[]
----

* `?` is "on error, early return"
