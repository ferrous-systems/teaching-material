= Unsafe Rust

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]

== !

Rusts type system provides many guarantees, but sometimes, they make specific solutions hard or impossible.

For that reason, Rust has the concept of "unsafe code".

== !

Unsafe code is allowed to:

-   freely access memory
-   dereference raw pointers
-   call external functions
-   declare values `Send` and `Sync`
-   write to unsynced global variables

== !

Not unsafe are:

-   conversion to raw pointers
-   memory leaks

== !

Unsafe code should never:

- be used to manage memory managed by a different allocator (e.g. construct a `std:::vec::Vec` from a C++ vector and drop it)
- cheat on the borrow checker, for example by changing lifetimes or mutability of a type. The most common source of "but I was so sure that works" bugs.

== Rust's little secret

When implementing data structures, unsafe isn't unusual.

Safe Rust is the worst language to implement linked lists. There's a full https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/[text on this]

== !

Unsafe code must *always* be marked `unsafe`.

== Traps of `unsafe`

-   Not all examples are that simple. `unsafe` *must* guarantee the invariants that Rust expects.
-   This *especially* applies to ownership and mutable borrowing
-   `unsafe` can lead to a value having 2 owners -&gt; double free
-   `unsafe` can make immutable data temporarily mutable, which will lead to broken promises and tears.

== !

Rust allows you to shoot yourself in the foot, it just requires you to take your gun out of the holster and remove the safety first.

== Practical example

As Rust forbids aliasing, it is impossible in safe Rust to split a slice into 2 non-overlapping parts.

== Highlight unsafe code in VSCode

* Will highlight which function calls are `unsafe` inside an `unsafe` block
* Helpful for longer `unsafe` blocks
