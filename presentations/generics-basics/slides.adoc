= Simple Generics

link:./index.html[Table of Contents]

== !

Generics are fundamental for Rust.

== Generic Structs

== Type Inference

Rust finds the types of all variables and generics with sufficient information.

This only applies *inside* of function bodies.

Signatures must always be fully specified.

== Generic Enums

--

- under the hood: the compiler silently copies for all instances of `Either`
-> the compiler does the boilerplate-ing for you!
- similar-ish to C++ templates

== Generic Functions

[.notes]
--

- the pattern is always "name<type>" regardless of whether name is a function name,
  parameter name, etc
--

Generic Functions have type parameters.

[source,rust]
----
include::./6.rs[]

Generic functions are used when computations can be expressed in an abstract way.

- possible detour: monomorphization, generic contraints (+ where clauses)
