== Declaration

[source,rust]
----
include::./1.rs[]

== Arguments

[source,rust]
----
include::./2.rs[]
----

== Returning

Returning is optional. Signatures must be complete. Note the `;`!

== Generic Functions

Generic functions have type parameters.

[source,rust]
----
include::./4.rs[]
----

== With Bounds

Generic functions can be _constrained_.

These are equivalent:

[source,rust]
----
include::./5.rs[]
----

== Functions for types

If we didn't have methods (like in C), we'd have to write this:

[source,rust]
----
include::./6.rs[]
----

== Associated Functions

Fortunately, Rust has a better solution than putting `square_` on all our
function names.

[source,rust]
----
include::./7.rs[]
----

== Methods that access data

When our function needs to access the data inside the associated type, we can use `&self`.

This is a shortcut for `self: &Self`, where `Self` is an alias for whatever `impl Foo` block we're inside of.

[source,rust]
----
include::./8.rs[]
----

== Methods that mutate data

When our function needs to mutate the data inside the associated type, we can use `&mut self`.

This is a shortcut for `self: &mut Self`, where `Self` is an alias for whatever `impl Foo` block we're inside of.

[source,rust]
----
include::./9.rs[]
----

== Methods that taken ownership of the data

When our function needs to take ownership of the variable associated type, we can use `self`.

This is a shortcut for `self: Self`, where `Self` is an alias for whatever `impl Foo` block we're inside of.
