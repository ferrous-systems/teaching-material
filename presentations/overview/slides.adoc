== What is Rust?

[.centered]
== Rust is an empathic systems programming language that is determined to not let you shoot yourself in the foot.

== A Little Bit of History

- Rust began around 2008
- An experimental project by Graydon Hoare
- Adopted by Mozilla
- Presented to the general public as version 0.4 in 2012
- Looked a bit Go-like back then

== Focus

- Rust has lost many features from 2012 to 2014
- Garbage collector, evented runtime, complex error handling
** All present once, now gone
- Orientation towards a usable systems programming language

== Development

- Always together with a larger project (e.g. Servo)
- Early adoption of regular releases, deprecations and an RFC process

== Release Method

- Nightly releases
** experimental features are only present on nighly releases
- Every 6 weeks, the current nightly is promoted to beta
- After 6 weeks of testing, beta becomes stable
- Guaranteed backwards-compatibility
- Makes small iterations easier

== Goals

- Explicit over implicit
- Predictable runtime behaviour
- Supporting stable software development for programming at large
- Pragmatism and easy integration
- Approachable project

== Rust wants to be usable first!

== !

Many examples in this course are very small, which is why we will also spend time discussing the impact of many features on large projects.

== The Three Words

- Safe
- Concurrent
- Fast

== Safe

- Rust is memory-safe
- No illegal memory access
- Deallocation is automated
- Warning: memory leaks are *safe* by that definition!

== Concurrent

- "Concurrency without fear"
- The type system detects concurrent access to data and requires synchronisation
- Also: Rust detects when unsynchronised access is safely possible!
- Protection from data races!

== Fast

- These properties are guaranteed at compile time and have no runtime cost!
- Optimizing compiler based on LLVM
- Features with runtime cost are explicit and hard to activate "by accident"
- No reflection
- Zero-cost abstractions
- "Pay what you use": Rust has features with a runtime cost in an explicit and visible way. Unused features do not come with an associated cost.

== Pragmatic

- Great tooling
- Sublanguage for unsafe memory access and techniques to handle these
- Great FFI support
- Great error messages by the compiler
- Rust gives support for many hard things and trusts you with the rest

== Where do Rustaceans come from?

From diverse backgrounds:

- Dynamic languages (JS, Rubyists and Pythonistas)
- Functional languages like Haskell and Scala
- C/C++
