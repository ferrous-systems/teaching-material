= Exercise: Files, Option and Result
:source-language: rust

In this exercise, you will learn

* how to open a file
* how to handle errors using the `Result`-type.
* how to use the `Option`-type.
* how to read a file line by line.
* how to count the number of lines in a file.

Both the `Option` and `Result` are similar in way. Both have two variants, and
depending on what those variants are, the program may continue in a different way.

The Option Type can have the variant `Some(<some other type>)` or `None`.
It is used, when you have to handle optional values, for example if you want to
be able to leave a field of a struct empty, go assign the option type to it.
If the field has a value, it is `Some(<value>)`, if it is empty, it is `None`.

The variants of the Result type are `Ok(t)` and `Err(e)`. It is used to handle errors.
If an operation was successful, `Ok(t)` is returned.
In `Ok(t)`, `t` can be the empty tuple or a return value.
In `Err(e)`, `e` contains an error message that can be printed.

[TIP]
====
Both types can be used with the `match` keyword. The received value is matched on patterns, each leads to the execution of a different expression.

----
match VALUE {
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
}

== Template

Clone the teaching material repository at https://github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material[github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material].

A template with example data can be found in `assignments/IO-assignment/template`.

== Task 1: Files and Errors

* Open the file "src/data/content.txt" using https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.open[File::open] and bind the result to the variable `f`.
* Find out what type the variable f is. Either your IDE shows you, or you can assign a random type to the variable, and run the program.
* `match` the two possible patterns, `Ok(file)` and `Err(e)` to an an appropriate expression, for example: `println!("File opened")` and `println!("Error: {}", e)`

TIP: IDEs often provide a "quick fix" to roll out all match arms quickly

== Task 2: Reading Files... and Errors

* import `std::io::prelude::*`
* To use the content of the file, bind the result of the `match` statement to a variable.
** In the other branch of the match statement, change `println!("Error: {}", e)` to `panic!("Error: {}", e)`
* Read the content of the file into a `String`. Use https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#method.read_to_string[Read#read_to_string].
* Print the entire content of the file using `println!`
* Handle all errors (the compiler will warn you if you miss one)

== Task 3: Reading files line by line... and Errors

* Construct a https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufReader.html[BufReader] around the file
* Print the content of the file line by line. The `lines()`- method returns an Iterator over the file.
* Print the number of lines the file contains.
* `lines` returns the `Result`-Type, use it to get to the actual `String`.
* Filter out the empty lines, and only print the the others. The https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.is_empty[is_empty] method can help you here.

== Task 4: Read URLs from file... and Errors

* Add `url = "2"` to your dependencies section in `Cargo.toml`
* Write a function that parses each line using the https://docs.rs/url/2.1.1/url/[Url Type]: `fn parse_url(line: String) -> Option<Url>`
** If a line can be parsed successfully, return `Some(url)`, `None` otherwise
** In the calling context, only print URLs that parse correctly
** Test the `parse_url` function

== Help

=== Typing variables

Variables can be typed by using `:` and a type.

[source,rust]
----
let my_value: String = String::from("test");
----

=== `match`

All arms of the match tree have to result in the same type.
