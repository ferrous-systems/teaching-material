= Exercise: TCP client
:source-language: rust

In this exercise, we will implement a simple TCP client.

You will learn how to:

* write a simple single-threaded client tool
* connect to your server and send/receive strings
* close parts of a bidirectional stream

== Task

1. Start a TCP connection on port `127.0.0.1:7878`
2. Send a message over
3. Close the write end of the connection
4. Print the response to the console

== Getting started

Use this template:

[source,rust]
----
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let arg = std::env::args().nth(1);

    let message = match arg {
        Some(msg) => msg,
        None => String::from("Default Message"),
    };


    //...
    Ok(())
}
----

Read the documentation for the `TcpStream`, especially the `connect()` and `shutdown()` methods.
